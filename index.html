                <q>Role playing isn't storytelling. If the dungeon master is directing it, it's not a game.</q>

                A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game; abbreviated RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within
                a narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. There
                are several forms of role-playing games. The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game (TRPG), is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing (LARP), players physically perform their characters'
                actions. In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used, while acting as the referee; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character. Several varieties
                of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) and their graphics-based successors, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). </p>

            <p>
                Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character, or team of characters, who undertake(s) quests, and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical
                mechanics. These electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs, but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling. This type of game is well-established, so some RPG-related game forms, such
                as trading/collectible card games (CCGs) and wargames, may not be included under the definition. Some amount of role-playing activity may be present in such games, but it is not the primary focus.[9] The term role-playing game is also
                sometimes used to describe games involving roleplay simulation and exercises used in teaching, training, and academic research.

            <p>The very basic tools that are required for the RPG, are pen and paper and a dice or two. Most systems uses up to 20 sided "dices". Also, most of the RPG games has a vast amount of information about the fantasy world that is played, plus there
                can be numerous set of rules about how e.g. a fight is to be fought. Here are some examples about the tools:</p>
