            <h1>Funny Stories</h1>
            <p id="intro">These stories are just a few of those situations that we have on a normal game. I'm for one playing RPG to experience the laughter, that comes from these situations.</p>
            <h2>Incriminating evidences:</h2>
            <p>
                The party is in the middle of a serial killing, in a small city. They gathered some evidences about the possible killer. <br /> GM - So, what have you left in your room? <br />Gamer - Nothing! <br />GM - So you have brought everything
                with you? <br /> Gamer - Yes! <br /> GM - So all those incirminationg evidences that you so far collected, is in your backpack, as of now...? <br /> Gamer (started to sweat) - If you ask me like this, than no!

            <h2>Lock-picking</h2>
            <p>
                The party has been interrogated many many people in the city, about the murders but so far it's futile. At one time, they want to break into a suspect house at daylight. The gamer drops the dices. The other gamer looks at it and says:
                <br /> - I think we should let this slide. <br /> Gamer2 - Probably didn't work. <br /> Gamer3 (sarcastic) - By accident you actually welded the door, so nobody will open this. <br /> Gamer2 (appalled) - I only drop 96. not 100! <br />                Game master - All right than we can forget this. <br /> Gamer2 - Okay. <br />Gamer1 - I think we should go to the prison, and interrogate the satyr. At least that's fun! <br />Gamer2 - Yeah, right. Let's beat out from him the info that
                we anyway already know. :P

            <h2>Ingenious spy</h2>
            <p>
                The gamer is the head of the local town guard. He orders one of his man (Hernando) to follow everywhere the suspicious inquisitor. Later that day, the inquisitor and the gamer is walking on the street side by side, after they sort of made peace with each
                other.
                <br />Hernando comes on.
                <br />Gamer - Oh, Hernando, what are you doing here?
                <br />Hernando - Errr...
                <br />Gamer - Oh, yes, you followed the inquisitor, right?
                <br />Inqusitor - Khm.
                <br />Hernando looks at the gamer squirmingly, than lean closer to him privately.
                <br />Hernando - Yes sir, but you know that he stands next to you right at the moment, right?
                <br />Gamer - Excellent observation Hernando! - Clapped him on the shoulder. - You are my man for a reason! I now promote you to private!
                <br />Hernando - But sir, I'm a private already!
                <br />Gamer - I know.
